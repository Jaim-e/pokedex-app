# **Building a *Pokédex App***

The goal of this project is to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. In addition to that, I used Bootstrap to perform several UI patterns such as Modals.

As soon as you open the site, you should be able to view a clean and minimal list of the API data (Pokémon names), displayed in buttons that can be clicked to see more details about them including an image of each Pokémon.

The App is full responsive and enabled in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

# Key Features
- Load data from an external API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=151)
- Display a list of 151 items ordered according to the number of the Pokémon
- Show a modal with characteristics of each item each time a button on the list is pressed

# Technical Features
- The app has CSS styling
- The app uses additional complex UI pattern
- The JavaScript code has been formatted according to ESLint rules
- The app has also a search bar that allows to search for a specific Pokémon by name
- The app works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11
- The app does not throw any errors when being used

# Tech Stacks
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- ESlint rules can be found in the .eslintrc file

# Deployment
To sum up, I put into practice data extraction from external API (parsing JSON), modals, use of technical CSS properties, IIFEs, Asynchronous code and debugging.

Files such as index.html, styles.css and scripts.js are stored in their minified versions in the "dist" folder.
In order to find the raw version of these files, you can do it inside the "src" folder.

Please, before finishing take a look at my <a href="https://jaim-e.github.io/simple-js-app/">Pokédex</a> App.
