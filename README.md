# **Building a *Pokédex App***

The goal of this project is to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. In addition to that, I used Bootstrap to perform several UI patterns such as Modals.

# Key Features
- Load data from an external API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=151)
- Display a list of 151 items ordered according to the number of the Pokémon
- Show a modal with characteristics of each item each time a button on the list is pressed

# Tech Stacks
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- ESlint rules can be found in the .eslintrc file

Thanks to my tutor Matthew Wacha and my Mentor Martin Macharia for their support and encouragement and especially thanks to my dear study buddy Alexander Offner, that even though we have a time difference of 9 hours, he was always close to offer his valuable help ♡.
